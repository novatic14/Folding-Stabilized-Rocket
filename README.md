Inteded for LAVC Computer Science Club

This repository contains the full CAD model and aerodynamic analysis of a 3D-printed, actively stabilized rocket using servo-driven canards and onboard IMU sensing. The design was created independently prior to presenting it as a project proposal for the LAVC Computer Science Club.
